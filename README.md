# pbAuth

[DEMO](https://pbauth.boshnik.com/)

pbAuth â€“ a powerful authentication, registration, and user profile management system for PageBlocks

### Features
 - Authentication and registration via POST requests
 - Password reset and change
 - User profile with editable data
 - Avatar upload
 - Adding users to groups
 - Validation and error display using Fenom
 - CSRF protection and flash messages support
 - Extendable controllers and templates


### Quick Start
**1. Enabling Routing**

For pbAuth to work, you need to enable routing in PageBlocks. Make sure the system setting **pageblocks_routing** is set to either **Route Only** or **Full API**.

**2. Connecting JavaScript for Forms**

If you want authorization and registration forms to work without page reload, enable the **pageblocks_load_scripts** setting. This will automatically connect the necessary scripts that handle form submission via AJAX, as well as error and message display.

**3. Adding the Authentication Chunk**

It's recommended to add one of the ready-made file chunks to your site header:
 - **auth** - classic panel with login/registration buttons and profile display
 - **auth_modal** - modal window (if you want to embed forms without separate pages)


### TODO
 - Two-factor authentication (2FA)
 - Authentication and registration via social networks
 - Resending confirmation link if it was lost or not delivered
